# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

**What is version control?  Why is it useful?**

  * Version control allows you to track, review, and revert to previous versions of your code. Additionally, version control allows you to collaborate and merge revisions from different people.  Using version control is beneficial because you can revert to a previous version in case that a change in the code is causing issues.

**What is a branch and why would you use one?**

  * Branches allow you to copy and diverge from the main branch and are part of the development process.  A new branch is created when fixing a bug or adding a new feature.  Creating a new branch ensures that unstable code is not committed to the main branch.

**What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**

  * Commits are save points in Git. A good commit message is a clear and concise note of the change made.

**What is a merge conflict?**

  * A merge conflict occurs when two branches change the same part of a file and then the branches merge. When you attempt to merge the branches, Git doesn't know which changes to accept so you will need to intervene to resolve the conflict.
