What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  HTML5 semantic tags make the page more readable and accessible to people with disabilities. The most useful are main, article, section, nav, aside, header, and footer.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  The browser displays elements from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  I learned how to make snippets on Sublime. Snippets can help speed things up and are very useful. Yes, I will create more snippets and download Emmet.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  Initially, the most difficult was knowing how to arrange and order the semantic tags. My partner and guide were very helpful discussing how to best arrange the semantic tags.-->
