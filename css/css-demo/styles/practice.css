1. CSS Cascading - Cascading means that in a given stylesheet, more than one rule can be applicable to a piece of HTML, so cascading determines which specific stylesheet rule applies to which piece of HTML.

The browser decides which rule based on the highest rule that is placed within the stylesheet. However, if there is CSS embedded within the index.html file, that takes precendence.

2. Pseudo selectors - is used to define a special state of an element.

selector:pseudo-class {
    property:value;
}

3. You can use CSS to select the child element of another element by using child selector.

id > p {
    background-color: blue;
}
