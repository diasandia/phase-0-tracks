#Breakout - Task List

# Creating a Task List for an individual who has a lot of errands and tasks to complete and multiple locations or stores to go to in order to complete them.

# Release 1
# Create a class for a Task List.
# All TaskList instances should have an owner and a due date passed in on creation. For instance, our owner could be "Tyler" and his due date would be "Sunday". The owner should not be changeable but you should be able to read it outside of the class. The due date should be readable and writeable outside of the class.
