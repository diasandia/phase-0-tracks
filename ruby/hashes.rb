#5.2 Arrays and Hashes

#PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS (pseudocode)
# Allow interior designer to enter client details (name, age, number of children, pets, decor theme)
# 1. Prompt designer/user for info
# 2. Convert user input to appropriate data type
# 3. Print hash back out to the screen when the designer answers all the questions
# 4. Give the user opportunity to update key (no loop needed)
    # A. If designer says "none" skip this
    # B. If designer says "decor_theme" (for example), your program should ask for a new value and update the :decor_theme key. (Hint: Strings have methods that will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.)
#5. Print latest version of the hash and exit the program
